# GSSP Coding Checkup

We would like to ask you, if you like, to try complete a small set of coding exercises in order to learn a bit more about your background. Don't worry, it is just one aspect of our evaluation procedure - but as you are certainly aware, scientific programming has become a major skill in hydrology and environmental sciences.

Please follow the below instructions carefully:

## 1. Register at Codesignal

Please visit the page https://codesignal.com and create an account for yourself ("sign up").

## 2. Login with your new account

If you are not yet logged in with your new account, please use the login button to do so.

## 2. Try to solve the exercises

When you follow the links below, you will find the exercises. Everything should be quite intuitive:

- On the left, you find a description of the task.
- On the right, you find an editor to write the code for the function that solves the task.
- On the upper right, you can choose your preferred programming language (*Matlab is not available*). In our lab, we mainly use `R` and `Python`, but if you prefer a different language, just see what is available.
- On the bottom right, you find the output console and the "Run sample tests" and "Submit" buttons. Before your `Submit` your solution, you should `Run sample tests` in order to check whether your code is accurate. You will get feedback whether the tests were succcessful. If not, use the console output to check what is wrong. When you `Submit` your solution, some "hidden" tests will be run, too, but usually you're pretty safe if `Run sample tests` was successful.

**So here are the exercises:**

- [Get the maximum!](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/K9GnDT8Bnb6i7tgin)

- [Flag faulty observations!](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/CzMTqQNqsEGHo8sd8)

- [Interpolate the whale's position!](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/SxxZ293vgzvwHeHny)

- [How long was the event?](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/65i3bCPLJbaai8Nqh)

- [Compute runoff concentration with the unit hydrograph!](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/u8ZMwDDRB2TsoPMGQ)

- [Count heat periods in a time series!](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/rGAF9o66W82cTZqaB)

You have as much time as you like to solve the exercises. But we will only consider those exercises which you will have solved within one hour from the end of our interview (we can see for each exercise the time at which you submitted the solution).

Good luck!
